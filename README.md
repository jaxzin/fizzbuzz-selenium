This is a QA engineering example. Please perform the following steps:

1. [Fork this repository](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo)
1. [Create a new branch](https://github.com/blog/1377-create-and-delete-branches)
1. Implement a simple interaction test with Selenium against espn.go.com.
  1. Your test should navigate to NFL > Scores link, click on it, and validate the browser is now on a page titled "NFL Scoreboard".

1. [Setup your fork for continuous integration](http://docs.travis-ci.com/user/getting-started/) and [for running Selenium](http://docs.travis-ci.com/user/gui-and-headless-browsers/) using [Travis-CI](https://travis-ci.org/) and [SauceLabs](http://saucelabs.com) and then update this README (in your fork) so it [includes the Travis build status image](http://docs.travis-ci.com/user/status-images/). https://travis-ci.org/imtiazhossain/fizzbuzz-selenium.svg?branch=imtiaz

## Tips
1. **Read the instructions thoroughly**, reading comprehension is a large part of the evaluation.
2. Emailing source files or executables will not be accepted, refer to tip #1.
3. An ideal submission will demonstrate how to use the [Page Object pattern](https://code.google.com/p/selenium/wiki/PageObjects).
4. Naming conventions are extremely important for maintainable code. A strong submission will adhere to the standard conventions of the language you choose to use, for example the [standard Java conventions](http://java.about.com/od/javasyntax/a/nameconventions.htm).
